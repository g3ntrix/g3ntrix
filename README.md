## 👋 Hi, I'm Komar

I'm a full‑stack developer and backend‑focused software engineer who enjoys turning real‑world problems into reliable, scalable systems. I care about clean architecture, maintainable code, and building products that people actually use.

## 💻 What I Work With

- **Backend**: PHP, Python, Go, RESTful APIs, authentication (JWT/OAuth), database design
- **Web**: HTML, CSS (including RTL), JavaScript (Vanilla JS), React, WordPress (themes & plugins)
- **Data & Cloud**: SQL/NoSQL databases, automation, cron jobs, OCI and other cloud platforms
- **Tools & Practices**: Git/GitHub, Docker, Linux, testing, performance optimization, monitoring and alerting

## 🔧 What I Like Building

- Production‑ready backends and APIs for web platforms and dashboards  
- Automation tools and bots that remove manual work  
- Custom dashboards, admin panels, and role‑based portals  
- Systems that are observable (logs, alerts) and easy to maintain over time  

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Better patterns for scalable backend architectures  
- Cloud‑native tooling and containerized deployments  
- Advanced automation and integration between different platforms
